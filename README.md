## Conferences

There are roles: Moderator, Speaker and regular User.
Moderator can:
- create events;
- create topics for reports;
- consolidate, propose, change the topic of the report for the speaker;
- regulate the time and place of the event.
  It is necessary to consider the possibility of:
- review past / future events;
- sort by date;
- sort by number of reports;
- sort by number of participants.

  Each Speaker has his own account. The speaker can view the list of events in which he participated. 
  The speaker can offer his report to the event, as well as offer himself as a speaker for free reports.
  The user can register for the event (optional, prevent re-registration - duplicate check by email). 
  There should be statistics of people who registered and how many physically came to the event â€“ by the moderator.
  (Optional, implement notification of participants and speakers by email about changes in planned activities)
